# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis- NLP

Welcome to the Twitter Sentiment Analysis project! This application utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and classify the sentiment of tweets as positive or negative. It leverages machine learning models to achieve high accuracy and provides insights into the general sentiment trends on Twitter.

Dataset Information

The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, your objective is to predict the labels on the test dataset.

For training the models, we provide a labelled dataset of 31,962 tweets. The dataset is provided in the form of a csv file with each line storing a tweet id, its label and the tweet.
